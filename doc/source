From version 1.0, tattertools has added multi-user support. Due to the problem about driving speed,
we started to use the 'Hermes' optimizer developed by Tatter and Company to make the public version.
If you found it too hard to modify tattertools or need the original source, visit 
http://dev.tattertools.com. You can get the sources without optimization process using Subversion.
