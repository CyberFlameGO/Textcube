From Textcube 1.5, we will offer you the source version only. Do not consider the message below.

------------------------
From version 1.0, Tattertools has added multi-user support. Due to the problem about driving speed,
we started to use the 'Hermes' optimizer, developed by Tatter and Company. Public version is 
optimized version with it. That's why you cannot modify the source code easily.
If you found it too hard to modify tattertools or need the original source, visit 
http://dev.textcube.org/. You can get the original sources using Subversion.
